# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.29.0][] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **`gh:` ecosystem prefix for `/tool-intel`.** Researches GitHub CLI
  extensions (installed via `gh extension install <owner>/<repo>` and
  invoked as `gh <name> ...`) into a new `gh_extension` Basic Memory
  schema with title format `gh-<owner>-<repo>` and directory `gh/`.
  Sixth ecosystem alongside `brew:`, `cask:`, `action:`, `docker:`,
  `vscode:`. Five-source enrichment with DeepWiki **conditional** —
  runs only when `gh release list` returns ≥1 release (alpha bash
  extensions like `gh-notify` aren't indexed and would 404). Mirrors
  `/people-intel`'s conditional DeepWiki pattern.
- **`gh_extension` schema** — frontmatter fields include
  `runtime_shape` (`binary | script | local`), `discovery_mechanism`,
  `host_command`, `naming_convention`, `language`, `source`. `local`
  is required despite Wave-2 design discussion suggesting drop —
  symlinked dev installs (`gh ext install .`) are real and present in
  the user's environment. The `runtime_shape` classification ladder
  in `references/ecosystem-gh.md` checks symlink first because
  symlinked dev installs contain `.git/` too and would otherwise
  misclassify as `script`.
- **`gh-extension` controlled tag** — added to the per-type required-
  tags table in `agents/knowledge-gardener.md` and
  `agents/knowledge-maintainer.md`. Tag vocabulary entry added to
  `~/.claude/references/raindrop-tags.md`.
- **Reciprocal schema cross-refs** — `schemas/github_action.md` and
  `schemas/brew_formula.md` gain `see also [[schema/gh_extension]]`
  relations. gh extensions often invoke or wrap actions; gh itself
  is brew-installed, so adjacency through both peers is genuine.
- **Three new reference files**: `schemas/gh_extension.md`,
  `skills/tool-intel/references/ecosystem-gh.md`, and
  `skills/tool-intel/references/note-template-gh.md`.

### Changed

- **`/tool-intel` SKILL.md** — Arguments table, dispatch table,
  Step 0 error message, Step 3 enrichment templates (Tavily, DeepWiki,
  changelog), and Step 4 conventions table all extended with `gh:`
  rows.
- **Sibling skill prefix lists** — `knowledge-ask/SKILL.md`'s prefix
  table and prose mention now include `gh:`. `knowledge-gaps/SKILL.md`
  description notes that gh extensions have no manifest and stay
  user-invoked (no auto-detect).
- **`hooks/session-start.sh`** prefix list extended with
  `gh:<owner>/<repo>`. Bash heredoc quoting verified intact via
  `npm run check:sh`.
- **`agents/knowledge-gardener.md`** — 8 prefix-mention spots updated:
  inventory `list_directory`, `schema_validate` calls, wiki-link
  search queries, observation-link queries, ecosystem→directory
  mapping, per-type required-tag table.
- **`agents/knowledge-maintainer.md`** — schema-validation list
  extended to 18 types (adds `gh_extension`), required-ecosystem-
  tag rule added, `Skill(skill: "tool-intel", args: "gh:...")`
  example added.
- **README.md, CLAUDE.md** — opener counts ("five → six categories"),
  tool-intel section, references file count comment
  (`12 files: 6 ecosystem + 6 note templates`).

### Notes

- **Patch version bump (semver 0.x: additive non-breaking).** New
  ecosystem prefix is purely additive — no existing notes break, no
  existing schemas change, no existing skill workflows alter their
  outputs for non-`gh:` invocations.
- **gh-audit-envs migration deliberately skipped.** The user's own
  `voxpelli/gh-audit-envs` is documented at `engineering/security/...`
  with type `engineering` and rich landscape content (competitive
  matrix, USP, GitHub roadmap analysis). Wave-2 research evaluated a
  split (thin `gh_extension` note + renamed engineering essay) but
  the user chose to leave it as-is — the landscape content is genuinely
  engineering-shaped, and `/knowledge-gaps` doesn't auto-detect
  installed gh extensions (no manifest), so no false-positive flagging
  risk. Revival trigger: if the engineering note acquires
  `runtime_shape`/`host_command` fields it can't carry, or if the
  upstream repo is retired.
- **`pattern:extensible-cli-tools` hub note deferred.** Singleton hub
  notes become orphans. Will revisit when a 2nd CLI-extension ecosystem
  (`git_extension` or `kubectl_plugin`) lands and the hub has ≥2
  concrete instances for authentic `[precedent]` and `[tradeoff]`
  observations.
- **Manifest detection deferred.** No checked-in installer scripts,
  `gh-extensions.txt`, or `~/.config/gh/extensions.yml` patterns
  observed in user repos. `gh:` stays user-invoked, mirroring `action:`.
  A 2-line grep parser is stubbed as a comment for the future-
  conditional path.

## [0.28.0][] - 2026-04-29

### Removed

- **PreCompact reflection hook retired.** No positive evidence of effectiveness
  surfaced across 7 sprints of BM/retro review; the user's own
  `Session Reflector Patterns` `[gotcha]` flagged its output as "low-quality
  changelog noise". Outcome of a 9-agent audit that triangulated the finding,
  ran an adversarial counter-pass to disprove it, and confirmed via doc-grep
  that no forward-facing references survive. RETRO-02 lesson preserved as
  historical record. Removes `hooks/precompact.sh`, the `PreCompact` matcher
  in `hooks.json`, and references in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, the project
  `MEMORY.md`, plugin layout trees, the "How it fits together" diagram, and
  the session-reflect skill's hook-comparison passages. Hook count: 6 → 5.

### Changed

- **`PreToolUse` gardener block uses `permissionDecision: "deny"`** (canonical
  2026 form) instead of legacy `decision: "block"`. Surfaces a labelled
  `[Plugin]` decision in the TUI and integrates with the post-fix
  `permissions.deny` precedence rules. Three test assertions in
  `check-hooks.mjs` updated atomically with the hook-output change to avoid
  a transient broken-test window.
- **`post-file-edit.sh` shfmt branch flipped to noisy-flag mode.** Replaces
  the silent `shfmt -w "$FILE_PATH" 2>/dev/null || true` (which swallowed
  every error) with a detect-then-fix pattern: `shfmt -d` surfaces the diff
  in `additionalContext`, then `shfmt -w` auto-fixes. Style drift becomes
  visible during edits instead of being absorbed silently.
- **`PostToolUseFailure` skill prose narrowed** in `skills/session-reflect/SKILL.md`
  and `skills/knowledge-ask/SKILL.md` to scope coverage to BM write tools only
  (`write_note`, `edit_note`, `schema_validate`, `schema_diff`, `schema_infer`),
  matching the matcher's actual coverage. The previous line claiming "covers
  tool-level errors" was actively misleading.
- **`SessionStart` audit reminder** now mentions `knowledge-maintainer`
  alongside `knowledge-gardener` so the two-pass audit-then-fix workflow is
  discoverable from the reminder text alone.

### Added

- **Two new hook integration tests** in `scripts/check-hooks.mjs` covering the
  shfmt branch: drift detection (asserts the diff appears in `additionalContext`)
  and clean-file silence (asserts zero JSON objects emitted). Closes the gap
  identified by the audit: prior to this release, the shfmt path had zero
  test coverage despite handling every shell-script edit in the plugin.

### Notes

- **Minor version bump (semver 0.x: breaking change).** PreCompact removal
  is the breaking part — users relying on automatic context-compaction
  reflection should invoke `/session-reflect` manually, or wait for the
  PostCompact research bead (vp-claude-m7u) to land.
- All 25 `check:hooks` integration tests pass. All four `npm run check` jobs
  green: `check:plugin`, `check:md`, `check:sh`, `check:hooks`.
- Three follow-ups filed as beads for later sprints:
  - **vp-claude-k4d** — broaden `PostToolUseFailure` matcher to non-BM MCP
    tools (Raindrop, Tavily, Readwise, DeepWiki) when retros surface real
    failures going unhandled
  - **vp-claude-pwp** — write-time wiki-link colon anti-pattern detector
    (`[[npm:foo]]` → `[[npm-foo]]` correction at `write_note` / `edit_note`
    time, gardener already catches these in periodic audits)
  - **vp-claude-m7u** — research `PostCompact` (v2.1.76+) as a potential
    replacement for the retired PreCompact, contingent on observed
    `compact_summary` input shape and MCP-tool access in post-compact context

## [0.27.1][] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Homebrew MCP as optional complementary source for `/tool-intel`** —
  integrates `mcp__homebrew__info` to fetch install analytics (30/90/365-day
  install counts plus build-error counts for formulae) that the
  `formulae.brew.sh` JSON API does not expose. Emits as `[popularity]`
  observations on `brew_formula` / `brew_cask` notes, matching the category
  already used by `/package-intel` for cross-ecosystem consistency. Tavily
  remains the primary structured-metadata source — reading the upstream
  implementation (`Homebrew/brew` PR #20041, `Library/Homebrew/mcp_server.rb`)
  showed the MCP returns human CLI text via `Open3.popen2e`, not JSON, so
  it complements rather than replaces the JSON API.
- **Graceful degradation** — when the MCP server is unavailable (stdio MCPs
  can disconnect mid-session; we experienced this while writing the change),
  the analytics step skips silently with no retry and no fabricated values.
  The rest of the `/tool-intel` research proceeds unchanged.
- **Schema additions** — optional `popularity?(array)` field on both
  `brew_formula` and `brew_cask` schemas plus a `[convention]` observation
  stating the MCP-only provenance rule. Dual-synced to the Basic Memory
  schema notes; all 52 existing formula notes and 5 cask notes remain
  valid (purely additive change).

### Notes

- Patch version bump (semver 0.x: additive, non-breaking, optional
  integration — no required install step for users who don't want the
  `[popularity]` observation).
- `mcp__homebrew__` added to `KNOWN_MCP_PREFIXES` in `validate-plugin.mjs`.
- Only `mcp__homebrew__info` is in `allowed-tools`. The other 13 MCP tools
  (`install`, `uninstall`, `upgrade`, etc.) stay out; opting in per-tool
  follows the tool-list hygiene rule in CLAUDE.md.

## [0.27.0][] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Socket.dev as 7th `/package-intel` source** — integrates
  `mcp__socket-mcp__depscore` to add supply-chain risk scoring (license,
  maintenance, quality, supply-chain, vulnerability) as a `[security]`
  observation. Empirically verified ecosystems: npm, pypi, cargo (our
  `crate:` prefix maps to Socket's `cargo` token), and gem. Go and
  composer currently return no data and skip silently — no error, no
  halting. Skill prose explicitly overrides Socket's default "stop
  generating code on low scores" behaviour: this is a research skill,
  not a code-generation gate.
- **README install instructions** for the new Socket MCP server
  (`claude mcp add --transport http socket-mcp https://mcp.socket.dev/`).

### Notes

- Minor version bump (semver 0.x: new source = additive but introduces
  an install-time dependency for users who want the new observation).
- `/tool-intel` is unchanged — brew/cask/action/docker/vscode are
  distribution channels, not package ecosystems Socket indexes.

## [0.26.1][] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **`/people-intel <name>` skill** (14th skill) — five-source person research
  (Basic Memory deep graph traversal, Raindrop, Readwise, Tavily, DeepWiki).
  Creates/updates structured person notes with bidirectional cross-linking,
  fourth-wall guardrail, anti-hagiography step (explicit controversy search),
  and cross-cluster discovery. DeepWiki is conditional (developer profiles
  only). Includes 2 reference files: note template and source guide.

## [0.26.0][] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **`/wander` skill** (12th skill) — purposeless knowledge exploration with 5
  modes: Random Walk (BM graph traversal), Time Machine (old+new bookmark pair),
  Cross-System Collision (Readwise highlight + Raindrop bookmark), Forgotten
  Shelf (old untagged bookmarks), Obsession Detector (recent topics with zero BM
  notes). Critical design constraint: never scores, ranks, or recommends —
  presents collisions and lets the user make meaning.
- **`/readwise-check <topic>` skill** (13th skill) — quick pre-research lookup
  reporting highlight count, document count, and reading depth for a topic across
  Readwise. Two API calls, compact output.
- **SessionStart `/wander` hint** — session start now mentions `/wander` and
  `/readwise-check` alongside existing `/knowledge-prime` and `/knowledge-ask`
  suggestions.

## [0.25.1][] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Personal content leakage** — removed hardcoded employer name (`040.se`),
  personal tag conventions (`040-work`, TypeScript→javascript+types), hardcoded
  collection ID (`69372352`), library size references (`13k+`), and
  Swedish-specific audit steps from published plugin files. All user-specific
  behavior now reads from the vocabulary file's YAML frontmatter.

### Added

- **Vocabulary file config fields** — `blocklist`, `context_tags`, and
  `conventions` frontmatter fields in `~/.claude/references/raindrop-tags.md`.
  Tag-sync seeds sensible defaults on creation and preserves config across sync
  cycles.
- **`--source` argument** for `/raindrop-triage --promote` — overrides the
  default AI-triaged source collection, solving the bootstrap problem for
  pre-triaged bookmarks.
- **Progressive disclosure** — extracted tag selection strategy and promote
  workflow from raindrop-triage SKILL.md into `references/` files, reducing
  SKILL.md from ~3,200 to ~1,800 words.
- **Count verification gate** in promote workflow — verifies processed + skipped
  = source total after all batches.
- **TodoWrite progress checklist** for the promote pass.
- **Collection discovery** in session-bookmarks — replaced hardcoded collection
  ID with `find_collections`/`create_collections` discovery pattern.

### Changed

- **raindrop-gardener** — Swedish/English parallel tag detection generalized to
  non-primary-language detection (works for any language pair).
- **Description trigger phrases** — added "deduplicate bookmarks", "find
  duplicate bookmarks", "tag unsorted", "process raindrop inbox" to
  raindrop-triage.

## [0.25.0][] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **`/raindrop-triage` skill** (11th skill) — interactive triage of unsorted
  Raindrop bookmarks with URL normalization dedup, research burst detection
  (temporal clusters of 3+ within 30min), theme-based clustering, vocabulary-
  grounded tag proposals, and batch-approval UX. Moves approved bookmarks to
  AI-triaged collection. A `--promote` pass classifies AI-triaged items into
  AI-sorted (default), AI-gems (golden), AI-archive, or AI-attention with
  structured note annotations. Operates within a 6-collection AI-managed
  namespace (AI-bookmarked, AI-triaged, AI-sorted, AI-gems, AI-archive,
  AI-attention) — never touches user-curated collections.

### Changed

- **Raindrop collection rule** — expanded from "AI-bookmarked only" to
  "AI-\* namespace only" (AI-bookmarked, AI-triaged, AI-sorted, AI-gems,
  AI-archive, AI-attention) in both global and project CLAUDE.md.
- **session-bookmarks blocklist narrowed** — removed `cool`, `web2.0`, and
  Swedish personal tags (active curation tags, not legacy); added `2` to
  numeric ratings. Aligned with raindrop-triage blocklist.
- **`argument-hint` frontmatter** added to 6 skills (package-intel,
  tool-intel, knowledge-ask, schema-evolve, tag-sync, raindrop-triage) —
  shows expected input format in the slash-command picker.
- **`paths` frontmatter** added to knowledge-gaps — skill conditionally
  activates when manifest files (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.) are touched.
- **`validate-plugin.mjs` expanded** — known-fields allowlist for skill
  frontmatter warns on unknown fields (catches typos); type validation for
  `argument-hint`, `paths`, `effort`, `maxTurns`, `context` fields.
- **Skill interaction conventions** added to CLAUDE.md — AskUserQuestion
  must not be in allowed-tools, preview-approve-execute pattern, TodoWrite
  for progress feedback.

## [0.24.1][] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **session-bookmarks** — removed dead reference to `legacy_avoid` and
  `overlap_groups` vocabulary frontmatter fields that were never added
- **raindrop-gardener** — removed hardcoded tag count "1,773" that would
  go stale

## [0.24.0][] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **`raindrop-gardener` agent** (4th agent) — read-only Raindrop tag auditor
  with 10 audit steps: library dashboard, tag inventory, naming violations,
  near-duplicate detection, mistagged bookmarks (via `find_mistagged_bookmarks`),
  orphan tags, legacy tags, co-occurrence analysis, Swedish/English parallels,
  and taxonomy gaps. Produces structured reports with exact `update_tags`/
  `delete_tags` tool calls as copy-paste recommendations. Uses 3 novel
  Raindrop MCP tools: `find_mistagged_bookmarks`, `fetch_current_user`,
  `fetch_popular_keywords`.

### Changed

- **`/session-bookmarks` hybrid tag selection** — tag selection now uses
  copy-from-similar as primary signal (searches for similar bookmarks,
  extracts their tags, counts frequency) with topic-match boosting for
  specific tags, a legacy tag blocklist (`5`, `4`, `cool`, `web2.0`,
  `for:*`, Swedish personal tags), vocabulary fallback for novel topics,
  and selection rules with BAD/GOOD examples. Empirically tested across
  6 scenarios against the real 13k bookmark library.
- **Two-pass `url_pattern` dedup** — duplicate checking now uses
  `url_pattern` for precise wildcard URL matching (Pass 1), falling back
  to semantic `search` only when no exact match found (Pass 2). GitHub
  URLs use owner/repo-scoped patterns for precision.

## [0.23.0][] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **`/tag-sync` skill** (10th skill) — fetches tags from Raindrop via `find_tags`,
  curates the top N by usage count, auto-characterizes each with a one-line
  description from sampled bookmarks, groups by cluster (Ecosystem, Architecture,
  Content Type, Other), and writes/syncs a vocabulary file at
  `~/.claude/references/raindrop-tags.md`. Follows the vendor-sync pattern from
  vp-beads. Supports `--reset` for full recreation. User-invocable as
  `/tag-sync [count|--reset]`.
- **`/session-bookmarks` skill** (9th skill) — scans the current conversation for
  1-3 high-signal URLs discovered during research, previews them with proposed
  tags and rationale, and creates bookmarks in the AI-bookmarked Raindrop
  collection (ID 69372352) after user approval. Signal heuristics exclude
  registry index pages, repo root pages, and user-pasted seed URLs. Auto-delegated
  from `/session-reflect` Step 6, or invocable standalone.
- **Canonical `url:` frontmatter field** — all 11 package/tool note templates now
  include a `url:` field pointing to the canonical registry page (npmjs.com,
  crates.io, formulae.brew.sh, etc.). Metadata-only — not a schema observation
  field. Docker template documents the `/_/` vs `/r/org/` URL conditional.
- **`project` schema** (20th schema) — for things you own and build, with ownership
  boundary test ("you build it → project; you consume it → service"). 9 notes
  (3 existing + 6 retyped from service).
- **Person schema +5 fields** — `connection`, `influence`, `influenced_by`,
  `influences`, `relates_to` relation fields based on 83-note frequency analysis.
- **Milestone schema +1 field** — `created_by` relation (16% usage).
- **Standard schema +2 fields** — `created_by` and `contrasts_with` relations.
- **vp-git 0.2.0 in marketplace** — added `voxpelli/claude-git` to the
  vp-plugins marketplace.

### Fixed

- **Session-reflect bookmark delegation** — clarified that `/session-bookmarks`
  is invoked via the Skill tool, not automatically.
- **Docker template URL** — added comment for community image URL pattern
  (`/r/org/name` vs `/_/name` for official images).

## [0.22.1][] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Slash-to-hyphen in prefixed titles** — extends v0.22.0 to also replace
  slashes with hyphens in 5 ecosystems that use them: action (`action:actions/checkout`
  → `action-actions-checkout`), npm scoped (`npm:@fastify/postgres` →
  `npm-@fastify-postgres`), composer, go, and docker community images. The
  title rule is now: replace all `:` and `/` with `-`; preserve `@` and `.`.
  Migration script in `TODO-obsidian-migration.md` updated to handle both
  colons and slashes in a single run.

## [0.22.0][] - 2026-04-05

### Breaking

- **Colon-to-hyphen prefix migration for Obsidian compatibility** — note titles
  and wiki-links now use hyphen delimiters (`npm-fastify`, `[[npm-fastify]]`)
  instead of colons (`npm:fastify`, `[[npm:fastify]]`). BM's
  `sanitize_for_filename()` already produces `npm-fastify.md` on disk — this
  aligns titles with filenames, enabling native Obsidian wiki-link resolution.
  User command syntax is unchanged (`/package-intel npm:fastify`). Affects all
  11 ecosystem prefixes: npm, crate, go, composer, pypi, gem, brew, cask,
  action, docker, vscode. Existing vault notes require a one-time migration —
  see `TODO-obsidian-migration.md` for a shell script and verification steps.

## [0.21.1][] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Observation sweep for knowledge-primer** — Step 4b searches for critical
  `[gotcha]`/`[breaking]`/`[limitation]` observations across the entire graph,
  not just dependency-matched notes. Results appear in a new "Other warnings"
  section of the context brief (max 3 entries). Added `search_notes` to both
  knowledge-primer agent and knowledge-prime skill tool lists.
- **Scope-leak self-check for session-reflect** — Step 3 now scans candidate
  observations for project-specific content (absolute paths, env vars,
  localhost references) before showing the preview. Three-tier classification:
  false positive (keep), generalizable (rewrite), not generalizable (drop).

### Fixed

- **Naming convention documented** — established `vp-` prefix convention for
  non-user-invocable skills in CLAUDE.md Skill frontmatter section
- **Release checklist added** — formal checklist in CLAUDE.md Releasing section
  covering version bump locations and source count propagation paths

## [0.21.0][] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **`vp-note-quality` skill** — non-user-invocable reference checklist
  preventing the fourth-wall anti-pattern (self-referential content in
  subject-domain notes). Contains 10 quality rules, violation examples, and
  enforcement guidance. Preloaded into agents via the `skills` frontmatter
  field — zero-latency context injection at agent startup.
- **Agent `skills` preloading** — knowledge-maintainer and knowledge-gardener
  now preload `vp-note-quality` via the native `skills` frontmatter field,
  injecting the full checklist into agent context at startup.
- **Maintainer `effort: high`** — the knowledge-maintainer now defaults to
  high effort for improved note prose quality during writes. Works on both
  Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6.
- **`[popularity]` observation category** in package-intel — fetches download
  statistics from registry APIs (npm weekly, crates.io/Packagist/RubyGems
  all-time). Omitted for PyPI (deprecated) and Go (no metric). Includes
  metric-window disambiguation (`downloads/week` vs `total downloads`).
- **Maintainer Step 2e** — fourth-wall quality check searches for red-flag
  phrases in edited notes and queues rewrites for user confirmation.
- **Gardener Step 10** — fourth-wall audit step searches for self-referential
  content and reports violations with severity classification.
- **Validator: agent `skills` resolution** — `validate-plugin.mjs` now
  verifies that skill names referenced in agent `skills` arrays resolve to
  actual `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` files, preventing phantom skill references.

### Fixed

- **package-intel Step 6/7 ordering** — Step 6 summary no longer references
  cross-links from Step 7 before it has run.
- **npm note template fence** — normalized from triple to quadruple backticks
  for consistency with all other ecosystem templates.
- **Bash hook false positive** — `pre-bash-no-python.sh` regex no longer
  matches `node_modules` or `nodemon` as `node` commands. Anchored to match
  `node` only as a standalone command.
- **Source counting discrepancy** — CLAUDE.md now matches SKILL.md in listing
  the six enrichment sources (DeepWiki, Context7, Tavily, Raindrop, Readwise,
  changelog) instead of counting Basic Memory as a source.

### Changed

- **Marketplace: vp-beads 0.9.2 → 0.10.0** — syncs marketplace entry with the
  vp-beads hardening release (command hook fix, trigger overlap removal,
  session-context dead code cleanup).

## [0.20.0][] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **`/knowledge-ask` skill** — freeform Q&A against the Basic Memory knowledge
  graph. Searches notes, loads candidates, traverses 1-hop neighbors, and
  synthesizes a cited answer with confidence tiers (Direct/Partial/No Coverage).
  Read-only — suggests `/package-intel` or `/tool-intel` when coverage is
  incomplete. User-invocable as `/knowledge-ask <question>`.
- **Skill routing table** in CLAUDE.md conventions — disambiguates
  `/knowledge-prime` (project-wide coverage) vs `/knowledge-ask` (topic Q&A)
  vs `/package-intel` (external research) vs `/knowledge-gaps` (audit).

### Changed

- **`/knowledge-prime` description** — added "NOT for" negative differentiator
  and coverage-focused trigger phrases; removed overlapping phrase that could
  route to `/knowledge-ask`.
- **SessionStart hook** — now suggests `/knowledge-ask` for topic-specific
  questions alongside existing `/knowledge-prime` hint.

## [0.19.0][] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- **session-reflector agent → `/session-reflect` skill** — converted from agent
  to skill so it runs in the main conversation context (agents cannot access the
  conversation transcript). The skill has the same 6-step workflow (extract →
  find targets → preview → write → relation check → report) plus a new Edge
  Cases section and `find_replace` failure fallback. User-invocable as
  `/session-reflect`.
- **knowledge-maintainer Step 1** — deduplicated the 40-line audit enumeration
  (17 `schema_validate` + 9 `schema_diff` calls) into a concise 4-step triage
  that references the gardener for comprehensive audits.
- **tool-intel freshness check** — replaced vague "consider scoping down" with
  a 3-tier decision table (<60 days / 60–180 / >180 days). Applied same fix to
  package-intel.
- **tool-intel DeepWiki scoping** — removed blanket vscode skip; DeepWiki now
  runs for `vscode:` when a public GitHub repo exists (aligning SKILL.md with
  ecosystem-vscode.md).

### Fixed

- **engineering.md schema** — `relates_to(array)` was missing `?` (required
  instead of optional), unlike all 16 other schemas. Changed to
  `relates_to?(array)`.
- **knowledge-maintainer** — removed phantom `write_note` from tools list
  (never directly called; new notes delegated to `/package-intel` via `Skill`).
- **post-file-edit.sh** — changed `systemMessage` to `additionalContext` to
  match all other hooks.
- **pre-bash-no-python.sh** — normalized `jq -cn` to `jq -n` for consistency.
- **tool-intel** — replaced bare `references/` paths with full
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/tool-intel/references/...` paths (6 locations).
- **concept.md schema** — added `relates_to?(array)` field and Relation
  Vocabulary entry.
- **service.md schema** — added `architecture?(array)` field.

### Added

- **Hook comments** — clarifying comments in `session-start.sh` (mod-4 audit
  cycle), `post-bm-failure-classify.sh` (heuristic pattern matching),
  `post-file-edit.sh` (optional shfmt).
- **CLAUDE.md** — added 2 missing scripts to table (`audit-helpers.sh`,
  `check-hooks.mjs`), added `check:hooks` to validation description, added
  `references/` directories to plugin layout tree.

## [0.18.3][] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- **knowledge-maintainer Step 2d** — added missing `[[crate:` prefix to
  wiki-link-in-observations search (had 10/11 prefixes, gardener had all 11).
- **session-reflector** — removed phantom `list_directory` from tools list
  (never called in workflow).
- **knowledge-prime** — fixed `Glob(pattern=".beads")` which never matches
  directories; changed to `Glob(pattern=".beads/*")`. Added pagination note
  for `recent_activity`.
- **tool-intel Step 4** — removed incorrect `search_type="text"` from
  fallback name search (should use hybrid, not FTS5).
- **schemas/npm_package.md** — updated stale "five-source" to "six-source".
- **Documentation** — fixed hook count from 5 to 6 (PreToolUse was missing),
  fixed source counts in layout tree (Five→Six, Four→Five), added missing
  hook scripts to README structure tree.

## [0.18.2][] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **standard-detection.md** — replaced broken FTS5 query `search_notes(query=
  "type: standard")` with proper `note_types=["standard"]` filter. Added word
  boundaries (`\b`) to grep patterns and broadened file glob to include Rust,
  Go, PHP, Python, Ruby extensions.
- **knowledge-gardener Step 4c** — added missing `search_type="text"` to all
  wiki-link-in-observations queries (inconsistent with Step 4).
- **knowledge-maintainer Step 2d** — added missing `search_type="text"` and
  `page_size=100` to all wiki-link-in-observations queries.
- **knowledge-maintainer Step 3** — replaced Glob with Read for root manifest
  detection (same node_modules recursion bug fixed in knowledge-gaps v0.18.1).
  Removed phantom `Grep` from tool list.
- **knowledge-prime and knowledge-primer** — replaced Glob with Read for root
  manifest detection.

### Added

- **UPSTREAM-basic-memory.md** — three new entries documenting
  `entity_types=["relation"]` for relation-index search, `note_types` filter
  for type queries, and `most_connected_entities`/`total_unresolved_relations`
  in project stats. Corrected "exact text match" claim to "FTS5 tokenized
  search".
- **CLAUDE.md** — new "Basic Memory search patterns" convention section
  codifying correct query approaches to prevent FTS5 assumption bugs.

## [0.18.1][] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **knowledge-gaps Step 0** — replaced `Glob` with `Read` for root manifest
  detection. Glob recurses into `node_modules/` returning 100+ false matches.
- **knowledge-gaps Step 10** — replaced broken `search_notes(query="[[npm:",
  search_type="text")` with relation-index approach using
  `entity_types=["relation"]`. FTS5 tokenizes brackets, making literal `[[`
  queries impossible. The new approach queries the relation index directly and
  checks `to_entity` absence to identify dead wiki-links.
- **knowledge-gaps Steps 14-15** — extracted to
  `references/concept-detection.md` (matching Steps 11-13 pattern). Fixed
  Step 14a to use `most_connected_entities` seeds + relation-index queries
  instead of broken FTS5 text search. Fixed Step 14b Readwise queries to
  derive from project stack and hub gap candidates instead of generic phrases.
- **knowledge-gaps tool list** — added `Bash` for `bm project info` quick-exit
  gate in Step 10. Added edge cases for Readwise and bm CLI unavailability.

## [0.18.0][] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Readwise as enrichment source** — `package-intel` gains Readwise as a 6th
  source (now six-source enrichment); `tool-intel` gains it as a 5th source
  (now five-source enrichment). Both use `readwise_search_highlights` and
  `reader_search_documents` to surface the user's curated reading highlights —
  expert-selected passages with high signal-to-noise ratio.
- **Post-write cross-linking** (Step 7) — both `package-intel` and `tool-intel`
  now search Basic Memory for existing notes that reference the newly written
  package/tool and add bidirectional `relates_to` wiki-links via `edit_note`.
  Turns one-way references into connected graph edges.
- **Raindrop content fetching** — both intel skills now use
  `fetch_bookmark_content` on the top 2-3 most relevant Raindrop bookmarks,
  extracting full article content instead of just titles and tags.
- **Multi-query research guidance** — `package-intel` Step 3 now advises
  asking 2-3 targeted questions per source (API design, gotchas, configuration)
  rather than one broad query.
- **Concept-level gap detection** — `knowledge-gaps` gains Steps 14-15 that
  detect hub topics referenced by 3+ notes but with no dedicated concept note
  (structural gap), and topics with 3+ Readwise highlights but no BM note
  (interest gap). Combined signals are flagged as highest priority.
- **Cross-linking convention** added to CLAUDE.md under Conventions.
- **Readwise** added to MCP Tool Dependencies table in CLAUDE.md.

### Changed

- **knowledge-maintainer** orphan linking enhanced to create bidirectional
  graph edges — when linking an orphan, also adds `relates_to` links FROM
  existing notes that reference the orphan back TO it.
- **`validate-plugin.mjs`** now recognizes `mcp__readwise__` as a known MCP
  prefix.

## [0.17.1][] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **REGRESSION: PreToolUse hook blocked all sessions** — the hook blocking
  script runtimes in Bash was project-global, affecting the main session and
  all agents. Now scoped to the knowledge-gardener agent only via the
  `agent_type` field in the hook input JSON. Main session and all other agents
  are completely unaffected.

## [0.17.0][] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Knowledge-gardener audit improvements** — Step 0.5 (`bm project info main
  --json`) for aggregate graph stats snapshot that gates Step 3 orphan
  detection. Step 4c for wiki-link-in-observations detection via
  `search_notes(entity_types=["observation"])` per ecosystem prefix. Step 7
  probe+scan split for scope-leak detection.
- **`scripts/audit-scope-leak.sh`** — CLI-first audit script for regex-based
  detection of project-specific content in cross-project BM notes. Three
  passes: relative paths, absolute paths, project-specific env vars.
- **Knowledge-maintainer Step 2d** — wiki-link-in-observations detection and
  auto-fix (strip `[[...]]` from observations, add to Relations).
- **`scripts/check-hooks.mjs`** — 16 integration tests verifying every hook
  emits exactly ONE valid JSON object on stdout. Catches the multi-object bug
  class that went undetected for 3 releases.
- **`validate-plugin.mjs` prompt-hook warning** — warns when hooks use
  `type: "prompt"` (silently non-functional for MCP calls per RETRO-02).

### Changed

- **Gardener Step 8a** extended to accumulate observation counts alongside
  tags (zero extra MCP cost). Step 9b uses accumulated counts.
- **CLAUDE.md** — added Scripts section documenting CLI-first audit utilities.
- **`check:sh`** extended to cover `scripts/*.sh`.

### Fixed

- **Gardener Step 0.5** — corrected to `bm project info main --json` (requires
  project name argument).
- **`audit-scope-leak.sh`** — replaced `eval echo` with safe tilde expansion,
  fixed IFS colon split, added jq dependency check, added missing `[[cask:`
  prefix to wiki-link detection.

## [0.16.1][] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **session-start.sh multi-object stdout** — the hook emitted 2-3 separate
  JSON objects but Claude Code reads only the first. The `additionalContext`
  (priming suggestion) and audit reminder have been silently dropped since
  v0.15.0. Now merges all content into a single `additionalContext` field
  using `jq -n`.
- **JSON fallback chain in post-bm-failure-classify.sh** — dropped `.tool_result`
  from error extraction (captures MCP response body, not error text).
- **knowledge-gaps Step 5 forward-reference** — tool-intel enrichment offers
  referenced Steps 6-9 output before those steps ran. Moved tool offers to
  Step 9 where the data is available.
- **knowledge-gaps Domain column** — removed from Step 4 template (no data
  provider existed).
- **knowledge-primer agent drift** — synced with knowledge-prime skill: added
  `--deep` flag, edge cases, Step 7 (suggest next steps), clarified
  `recent_activity` fetch timing.

### Changed

- **knowledge-gaps Steps 11-13 extracted** to `references/standard-detection.md`
  for structural consistency with package-intel and tool-intel reference
  patterns.
- **CLAUDE.md hook conventions** — documented single-JSON-object stdout rule,
  CWD assumption (project root), and PreCompact as intentional exception to
  the skill-reference pattern.

### Removed

- **Phantom `Glob` from tool-intel** — was `list_directory`'s `file_name_glob`
  parameter, not the Claude `Glob` tool.

## [0.16.0][] - 2026-03-28

### Changed

- **PostToolUse validation hook converted from prompt to command** — prompt hooks
  spawn Haiku without MCP access, making the `schema_validate` call silently
  non-functional since creation (same bug class as PreCompact v0.1–v0.10,
  documented in RETRO-02). Now emits `additionalContext` so the main session
  calls `schema_validate` with full MCP access.
- **PostToolUseFailure hook converted from prompt to command** — pattern-matches
  BM tool errors into five categories (server-unavailable, note-not-found,
  invalid-argument, permission-error, unknown) and emits `additionalContext`
  with recovery guidance. Eliminates misleading "hook stopped continuation"
  framework labels.
- **Wiki-link-in-observations warning** added to all 11 note templates and both
  research skill SKILL.md files. BM's parser treats `[[` as a relation boundary
  — text before it becomes `relation_type` (max 200 chars), causing validation
  failures.
- **tool-intel description** — added missing trigger phrases for cask, docker,
  and vscode query patterns.
- **knowledge-prime Step 3** — removed git/Bash dependency (Bash not in
  allowed-tools); now uses `recent_activity` for the boost pass.
- **CLAUDE.md hook conventions** — updated to reflect command-only hook pattern
  and document prompt hook MCP limitation.

### Removed

- **`list_directory` from schema-evolve allowed-tools** — phantom tool, never
  called in the workflow.

## [0.15.0][] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **`/knowledge-prime` skill** — on-demand project context priming from Basic
  Memory. Detects the project stack (package.json, Cargo.toml, Brewfile, etc.),
  cross-references dependencies against BM notes, scores relevance using a
  three-pass algorithm (dep match → graph expansion → beads/git boost), loads
  critical observations (`[gotcha]`, `[breaking]`, `[limitation]`), and produces
  a concise context brief. Supports `--deep` flag for extended output (2000-token
  budget, top 12 notes, additional observation categories).
- **`knowledge-primer` agent** — autonomous read-only agent for project context
  priming. Same workflow as the skill but runs as a subagent. Pinned to `sonnet`
  (read-only, matches gardener). The "before work" counterpart to
  `session-reflector` (which captures knowledge "after work").
- **Tag alignment in `knowledge-gardener`** (Step 0 + Step 8) — loads the Tag
  Vocabulary Standard at audit start, then audits tags across all note types:
  non-canonical form detection, retired tag detection, missing required per-type
  ecosystem tags, out-of-vocabulary tags, and tag count checks (3–7 range).
- **Tag auto-fix in `knowledge-maintainer`** (Step 2b) — three auto-fix
  sub-steps: normalize canonical forms (deterministic 1:1 renames), remove
  type-echo and retired tags, add missing required ecosystem tags. All
  deterministic and low-risk — applied without confirmation.
- **SessionStart hook enhanced** — now emits `additionalContext` suggesting
  `/knowledge-prime` for project context priming when the task involves
  dependencies or tools. Also suggests `/knowledge-gaps` and `/schema-evolve`
  for deeper analysis.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md documentation refresh** — skills count from 4 to 5, agents count
  from 3 to 4, plugin layout diagram updated, new component descriptions added
  for knowledge-prime and knowledge-primer.
- **`plugin.json` description** — now mentions project context priming and tag
  alignment.
- **`marketplace.json` description** — now mentions project context priming.

## [0.14.1][] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **`concept` schema evolved** — added `principle`, `opportunity` (observations)
  and `enables`, `implements`, `depends_on` (relations) based on 33% usage
  across 6 notes. Removed unused `relates_to` and `complements` (0% usage).
- **`milestone` schema pruned** — removed 3 dead fields at 0% usage: `failure`,
  `anti-pattern`, `proven`.

## [0.14.0][] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **CI workflow** — added `permissions: contents: read` (principle of least
  privilege) and bumped `actions/checkout` v4 → v5. Aligns with vp-beads
  v0.6.2 CI patterns.
- **PostToolUseFailure matcher expanded** — now covers `schema_validate`,
  `schema_diff`, and `schema_infer` in addition to `write_note`/`edit_note`.
  Schema tools can fail during trend-review sprints and benefit from the same
  five-category error classification and recovery guidance.
- **Script naming: `check:shell` → `check:sh`** — standardizes npm script
  name to match vp-beads convention.

## [0.13.1][] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- **`schema-evolve` skill reviewer fixes** — clarified "No schema found" edge
  case (directs to `/package-intel` or `/memory-schema` instead of ambiguous
  "suggest seeding"), added pre-existing divergence edge case (compare BM and
  local before evolving), replaced "revert and retry" with explicit error
  reporting strategy, added trigger phrases (`check schema`, `schema audit`,
  `schema changes`).
- **knowledge-gardener** — added `Glob` to tools list (step 4b needs it for
  `UPSTREAM-*.md` file detection).
- **knowledge-maintainer** — removed `\[config\]`→`\[config\]` no-op row from
  observation normalization table.
- **`post-file-edit.sh`** — added early exit guard with comment when
  `PLUGIN_ROOT` is unset, removed redundant inline guards.
- **CI workflow** — added `shfmt` installation step (`shellcheck` is
  pre-installed on ubuntu-latest but `shfmt` is not). Mirrors vp-beads CI.

### Changed

- **`plugin.json` description** — now mentions schema evolution.
- **vp-beads marketplace** — bumped to v0.6.2.
- **Adopted vp-beads v0.6.0 patterns:**
  - Annotation-not-deletion for resolved observations in knowledge-maintainer
  - Optional structured metadata on observations (`Ownership:`, `Since:`)
  - Cross-plugin friction awareness in knowledge-gardener step 4b

## [0.13.0][] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **`/schema-evolve <type>` skill** — frequency-driven schema drift detection
  and evolution. Runs `schema_diff` + `schema_infer`, proposes field additions
  (>25% usage), removals (0% usage), and cardinality fixes. Dual-syncs both
  the BM schema note and local `schemas/` file after approval. Includes a
  watch list (10-24% usage) for emerging fields.
- **PostToolUse `Edit|Write` hook** — combined `command` hook that auto-formats
  shell scripts with `shfmt -w` after edits to `hooks/*.sh`, and emits a
  `systemMessage` reminder to sync BM when editing `schemas/*.md` files.
  Silently skips if `shfmt` is not installed.
- **Observation category normalization in knowledge-maintainer** (step 2a) —
  two-tier mapping: deterministic auto-fixes for unambiguous tag renames
  (`[install]`→`[usage]`, `[mechanism]`→`[purpose]`, etc.) and confirmation-
  gated mapping for ambiguous tags. Schema-type-aware — checks the note's
  schema before mapping to avoid false corrections.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md documentation refresh** — hooks count corrected from 3 to 5
  (adds PostToolUseFailure and Edit/Write hooks), skills count from 3 to 4,
  plugin layout diagram updated.

## [0.12.1][] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Schema evolution — 3 schemas updated based on drift analysis:**
  - `github_action`: added `version?(array)` (89% usage) and `usage?(array)`
    (78% usage) — both were widely used but not in the schema
  - `npm_package`: added `security?(array)` (25% usage) and synced
    `api?(array)` from BM — aligns schema with how package-intel actually
    writes notes
  - `standard`: added `trend?(array)` (38%), `pattern?(array)` (25%),
    `complements?` (25%), and `lesson_for?` (25%) — all emerged organically
    in IndieWeb standard notes

## [0.12.0][] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **5 new knowledge schemas** — `standard`, `concept`, `milestone`, `service`,
  `person` types for documenting protocols, movements, historical events,
  products, and key figures. Each schema added to `schemas/` and synced to BM.
- **Domain standard detection in `/knowledge-gaps`** (Steps 11–13) — searches
  BM for `type: standard` notes, greps the codebase for mentions, classifies
  by reference count (key/referenced/undocumented), and appends a Domain
  Standard Coverage section to the gap report. Skips ubiquitous standards
  (HTTP, HTML, JSON, etc.).
- **Schema validation for new types in agents** — `knowledge-gardener` and
  `knowledge-maintainer` now run `schema_validate`, `schema_infer`, and
  `schema_diff` for the 5 new types.
- **CLAUDE.md updated** — schema count from twelve to seventeen, new types
  listed under Knowledge types.

### Fixed

- **Schema quality issues across all 5 new schemas:**
  - Converted multi-value observation fields to arrays (`limitation`,
    `innovation`, `design`, `pattern`, `trend`, `gap`, `risk`, `lesson`,
    `failure`, `anti-pattern`, `precedent`, `insight`)
  - `milestone`: renamed `validation` → `proven` (collided with
    `settings.validation`); dropped `cautionary` and `competitive-gap`
    (12→10 observation fields)
  - `concept`: removed domain-specific fields `ux`, `accessibility`,
    `display_for`
  - `person`: `source` now required (matches other 4 schemas)
- **`UPSTREAM-claude-code.md`** — escaped `[degraded]` bracket to fix
  pre-existing remark warning.

## [0.11.0][] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **PostToolUseFailure hook** — classifies Basic Memory write/edit failures
  into five categories (server unavailable, invalid argument, note not found,
  permission error, unknown) and surfaces actionable recovery guidance as a
  systemMessage. Short timeout (10s) — classification only, no retry.
- **Validator: agent color and model checks** — validates against the allowed
  sets (`blue`/`cyan`/`green`/`yellow`/`magenta`/`red` for colors;
  `inherit`/`sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku` for models).
- **Validator: tool-reference audit** — cross-checks `mcp__*__*` patterns in
  skill/agent prose against their declared `allowed-tools`/`tools` frontmatter,
  catching references that would be silently blocked at runtime.
- **Validator: expanded hook type allowlist** — now accepts `agent` and `http`
  in addition to `prompt` and `command` (future-proofing).

### Changed

- **PreCompact hook converted from prompt to command** — the previous
  `type: "prompt"` hook was non-conforming (PreCompact only supports command
  hooks per official docs) and prompt hooks spawn a separate Haiku instance
  with no MCP tool access, making the reflection instructions unreachable.
  Now emits `additionalContext` JSON via a shell script, injecting reflection
  instructions into the main Claude session which has full MCP access.
  Timeout drops from 30s to 5s (static JSON output).

### Fixed

- **`session-reflector` color** — `purple` → `magenta` (purple not in the
  valid agent color set).
- **CLAUDE.md agent count** — "Agents (2)" → "Agents (3)", wrong since
  session-reflector was added in v0.3.0.
- **Removed duplicate `note-template.md`** — identical to
  `note-template-npm.md` and unreferenced by any skill.
- **Cross-reference comments** added between `package-intel` and `tool-intel`
  at Steps 1 and 5 (shared existence-check and write/update patterns).

## [0.10.1][] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- **`knowledge-gardener` model set to `sonnet`** — read-only agent with high
  tool volume (50-100+ calls) now pinned to sonnet for consistent audit quality
  regardless of session model. Zero write risk makes this safe — worst case is a
  less thorough report, never data corruption. Matches the pattern used by
  official Claude Code plugins (`code-explorer`, `code-architect`). The other
  two agents (`knowledge-maintainer`, `session-reflector`) remain at `inherit`.

## [0.10.0][] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **SessionStart: cycle-aware graph-audit reminder** — `hooks/session-start.sh`
  now counts `RETRO-*.md` files and emits an additional `systemMessage` on
  every 4th sprint: an advance warning on sprint mod=3, an active reminder on
  sprint mod=0. Silent in all other sprints. Mirrors vp-beads' trend-review
  cycling pattern, adapted for graph health (knowledge-gardener) instead of
  sprint workflow.
- **`## Releasing` section in `CLAUDE.md`** — documents the version bump
  checklist (`plugin.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `marketplace.json`) and cache-lag
  note for plugin consumers. Mirrors vp-beads' CLAUDE.md release section.
- **`## Edge Cases` section in `knowledge-gaps`** — defensive handling for
  missing manifests, empty Brewfiles, workflow files with no `uses:` lines,
  and missing BM ecosystem directories. Mirrors vp-beads' sprint-review edge
  case documentation pattern.

## [0.9.0][] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **`read_note` guard before missing-sections append in `knowledge-maintainer`**
  — the "Missing sections" fix example previously omitted the required
  `read_note` step, risking blind append of duplicate section headers.
  Now explicitly reads first, appends only what's confirmed absent.
- **`build_context` activated in `session-reflector` Step 2** — after
  `search_notes` identifies candidate notes, the agent now traverses each
  candidate's immediate graph neighborhood (`depth=1`) before committing,
  surfacing better targets and preventing duplicate observations.
- **Graph curation step in `tool-intel` Step 4** — mirrors the curation
  pattern already present in `package-intel`: check how the tool is
  referenced in the knowledge graph before writing, to populate `## Relations`
  back-links and avoid duplicating linked-note observations.
- **Step 10 "Detect dead wiki-links" in `knowledge-gaps`** — searches
  existing notes for `[[prefix:name]]` wiki-links that point to non-existent
  notes, cross-references against `list_directory` results already collected,
  and adds a "Referenced but not documented" section to the gap report.
  Uses `search_type="text"` (exact match) for structural `[[` syntax.

## [0.8.0][] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **"Relationship to vp-beads" section in CLAUDE.md** — documents how
  `/package-intel` and `/tool-intel` output feeds vp-beads' upstream-tracker
  and the session-reflector ↔ retrospective mental model. Mirrors the
  reciprocal section already present in vp-beads' CLAUDE.md.
- **vp-beads integration section in `session-reflector` agent** — guidance
  for beads projects: log upstream friction via `/upstream-tracker` when
  discovered during research; use session-reflector for in-sprint capture and
  vp-beads `/retrospective` for end-of-sprint synthesis.
- **`shfmt -d` added to `check:shell`** — shell scripts now validated for
  both linting (`shellcheck`) and formatting (`shfmt -d`), matching vp-beads'
  shell validation pattern. Requires `brew install shfmt`.

## [0.7.1][] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **`security?(array)` missing from `github_action` and `docker_image` schemas** — `tool-intel` writes `[security]` observations (CVEs, supply-chain advisories) for action and docker notes, but neither schema defined the field. PostToolUse validation hook fired spurious unknown-field warnings on every such note. Field added to both schemas (+ BM mirrors) with a convention observation distinguishing `security` (advisory/CVE info) from `gotcha` (usage pitfalls).
- **`schema_diff` absent from `knowledge-gardener` tools list** — Added in `knowledge-maintainer` but never mirrored to the read-only gardener. Added `mcp__basic-memory__schema_diff` to the tools list and a `schema_diff` block in Audit Check 2 (5 types: `npm_package`, `crate_package`, `brew_formula`, `brew_cask`, `engineering`) with guidance to report drift findings without treating them as validation failures.
- **`brew_formula` missing from `schema_infer` in `knowledge-gardener`** — Only `npm_package`, `crate_package`, and `engineering` were listed; `brew_formula` was absent despite being a high-volume type. Added.
- **"Three enrichment layers" counted incorrectly** — `tool-intel` SKILL.md and CLAUDE.md said "three enrichment layers" but listed four items (frontmatter, type-specific section, Observations, Relations). Restructured as "three core layers + one type-specific section" to match package-intel's actual three-layer model.

## [0.7.0][] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`schemas/` directory** — version-controlled source of truth for all 12 Basic Memory note schemas, mirroring schema notes in BM. Enables first-install seeding and keeps plugin repo + BM in sync.
  - **Package schemas (6):** `npm_package`, `crate_package`, `go_module`, `composer_package`, `pypi_package`, `ruby_gem`
  - **Tool schemas (5):** `brew_formula`, `brew_cask`, `github_action`, `docker_image`, `vscode_extension`
  - **Knowledge schemas (1):** `engineering`

### Fixed

- **`brew_cask` schema missing three fields** — `perf?(array)`, `relates_to?(array)`, and `depends_on?(array)` were absent from the schema but used in notes. Discovered via `schema_diff`; all three added to both the BM note and `schemas/brew_cask.md`.
- **PostToolUse hook false positives** — The schema validation hook was firing on schema definition notes themselves (notes in the `schema/` directory), producing spurious validation errors since schema notes aren't package/tool notes. Hook prompt now short-circuits when the permalink contains `/schema/`.

## [0.6.0][] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`/tool-intel <prefix>:<name>` skill** — four-source research pipeline for developer environment and CI/CD tooling. Supports five tool types:
  - `brew:<name>` — Homebrew formulae (formulae.brew.sh API)
  - `cask:<name>` — Homebrew casks (formulae.brew.sh/cask API)
  - `action:<owner>/<repo>` — GitHub Actions (tavily_extract on action.yml + README)
  - `docker:<image>` — Docker Hub images (hub.docker.com API; official and community images)
  - `vscode:<publisher>.<ext>` — VSCode extensions (Open VSX API, VS Marketplace fallback)
- **`skills/tool-intel/references/` — ecosystem guides** — five reference files (`ecosystem-brew.md`, `ecosystem-cask.md`, `ecosystem-action.md`, `ecosystem-docker.md`, `ecosystem-vscode.md`) covering registry APIs, field docs, and security notes for each tool type
- **`skills/tool-intel/references/` — note templates** — five templates (`note-template-brew.md`, `note-template-cask.md`, `note-template-action.md`, `note-template-docker.md`, `note-template-vscode.md`) with type-specific content sections (`## Common Usage` for brew/cask, `## Inputs & Outputs` + `## Permissions` for actions, `## Tags` + `## Base Layers` for Docker, `## Features` + `## Configuration` for VSCode)
- **`/knowledge-gaps` extended with Steps 6–9** — detects and parses `Brewfile`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `Dockerfile`/`*.dockerfile`, `.vscode/extensions.json`; cross-references against Basic Memory `brew/`, `casks/`, `actions/`, `docker/`, `vscode/` directories; adds a tool coverage section to the gap report with `/tool-intel` enrichment offers
- **Five new tool note types in PostToolUse hook** — `brew_formula`, `brew_cask`, `github_action`, `docker_image`, `vscode_extension` validated after writes
- **`knowledge-gardener`** — inventory, schema validation, and relation integrity extended for all five tool directories and types
- **`knowledge-maintainer`** — assessment and enrichment step extended; auto-detects tool manifests and invokes `/tool-intel` for undocumented tools alongside existing `/package-intel` for packages
- **SessionStart hook** — now mentions `/tool-intel` and lists all five tool prefixes

## [0.5.0][] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Multi-ecosystem support for `/package-intel`** — extended from npm-only to six ecosystems: npm, Rust crates, Go modules, PHP Composer, Python PyPI, Ruby gems. Each ecosystem has a dedicated reference file (`ecosystem-crates.md`, `ecosystem-go.md`, etc.) and note template (`note-template-crates.md`, etc.) under `skills/package-intel/references/`.
- **`/knowledge-gaps` extended to all six ecosystems** — scans `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `composer.json`, `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`, and `Gemfile` in addition to `package.json`. Import frequency tiering adapted per language (e.g. `use <crate>::` for Rust, `"<module/path>"` for Go).
- **Ecosystem-prefixed invocations** — `/package-intel crate:serde`, `/package-intel pypi:requests`, etc. No-prefix still defaults to npm.
- **RUSTSEC / PyPA / RubySec advisory search** — Tavily security query adapted per ecosystem advisory format.
- **PostToolUse hook extended** — added type checks for `crate_package`, `go_module`, `composer_package`, `pypi_package`, `ruby_gem` alongside the existing `npm_package` check.
- **`knowledge-gardener` extended** — inventory, schema validation, and relation integrity checks added for `crates/`, `go/`, `composer/`, `pypi/`, `gems/` directories and their corresponding note types.
- **`knowledge-maintainer` extended** — schema assessment and enrichment steps updated for all six package ecosystems; offers `/package-intel crate:*`, `pypi:*`, etc. for Tier 1 gaps.
- **`Glob` re-added to `knowledge-gaps`** — removed in 0.2.0 (was unused); re-added in 0.5.0 for multi-ecosystem manifest detection (`Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.).
- **SessionStart hook updated** — lists multi-ecosystem prefixes (`crate:`, `pypi:`, `go:`, `composer:`, `gem:`) in the session context message.

## [0.4.0][] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- **Plugin renamed from `vp-claude` to `vp-knowledge`** — the old name
  didn't reflect what the plugin does (Basic Memory knowledge graph
  management). If you have `vp-claude@vp-plugins` installed, uninstall
  and reinstall as `vp-knowledge@vp-plugins`.
- **`vp-plugins` marketplace adds `vp-beads`** — sprint workflow automation
  (retrospectives, upstream vendor tracking) now available as a separate
  installable plugin at `voxpelli/vp-beads`.

## [0.3.0][] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **Orphan detection was looking in the wrong place** — `build_context(url="memory://npm/*")` only traverses connected nodes; zero-link notes are invisible to it. Replaced with a two-pass approach: `read_note(..., output_format="json")` inspects the structured `relations` field to find zero-outgoing notes, then `build_context` on each candidate confirms zero-incoming. True orphans (zero in + zero out) are now reliably detected.
- **`recent_activity` pagination missing** — stale note detection in `knowledge-gardener` did not paginate `recent_activity` results, so large graphs could miss notes. Added explicit instruction to paginate until `has_more=false`.
- **Confusing identifier example in `package-intel`** — `read_note(identifier="npm/npm-<sanitized-slug>")` implied the caller must sanitize the name. The title form `npm:<package-name>` resolves identically and matches the `[[npm:pkg]]` wiki-link convention. Replaced throughout.

### Changed

- **Removed `delete_note` from `knowledge-maintainer`** — archiving uses `move_note`; deletion is irreversible. Removing the tool prevents accidental permanent loss. Notes that must be deleted can be removed via the Basic Memory CLI or `memory-lifecycle` skill.
- **`knowledge-maintainer` autonomy rules** — "Deleting or archiving notes" split into "Archiving notes (move to `archive/` via `move_note`)" and a note that permanent deletion is unavailable from the agent.

### Added

- **`agents/session-reflector.md`** — on-demand reflection agent. User-triggered counterpart to the automatic PreCompact hook. Reviews the conversation, extracts candidates, shows a preview grouped by target note, waits for approval, then writes. Uses the same `[category]` observation vocabulary as PreCompact for consistency.
- **Freshness check in `package-intel` step 1** — if an existing note was updated within 60 days, skip Tavily and Raindrop (low churn) and focus DeepWiki/Context7 on recent changes. Notes older than 60 days or missing trigger the full five-source pipeline. Previous `[gotcha]` and `[limitation]` observations are surfaced to guide the new research pass.

## [0.2.0][] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **Agent prompts generated Python scripts instead of calling MCP tools** — `python`-tagged code blocks in `knowledge-maintainer.md` caused the model to produce executable Python and run it via Bash rather than invoking MCP tools directly. Replaced all ` ```python ` fences with bare fences and added an explicit "call MCP tools directly, never scripts" directive.
- **`noteType` → `note_type`** — Wrong parameter name in `schema_validate` and `schema_infer` calls in both agents. Basic Memory uses snake_case throughout.
- **`npm-package` → `npm_package`** — Wrong type value. Basic Memory enforces snake_case for all frontmatter `type` fields; `npm_package` is canonical.
- **Reversed find-replace in maintainer** — The frontmatter-fix example had `find: npm_package, replace: npm-package` — backwards, would actively corrupt correct notes. Fixed to `find: npm-package, replace: npm_package`.
- **Broken `append`+`section` pattern** — Orphan-linking example used `operation="append", section="Relations"`, which appends to end of file, not end of section. Replaced with the correct `find_replace` pattern. Both agents now document this gotcha.
- **Double-prefix bug in `package-intel`** — `read_note(identifier="npm/npm-<slug>")` example had a spurious `npm/` prefix. Correct form is `npm/<package-name>`.

### Changed

- **Removed `Bash` from `knowledge-gardener`** — the agent is read-only and operates entirely through Basic Memory MCP tools; no workflow step needs shell access. Removing Bash structurally prevents script execution.
- **Removed `Bash` from `knowledge-maintainer`** — all write workflows use MCP tools or invoke skills via the `Skill` tool (which carries its own permissions). No workflow step in the agent itself needs shell access.
- **Removed `Agent` from `knowledge-maintainer`** — no workflow step delegates to a sub-agent. The initial audit is performed inline; `/package-intel` is invoked via `Skill`, not `Agent`.
- **Removed 8 external research tools from `knowledge-maintainer`** — DeepWiki, Context7, Tavily, and Raindrop tools belonged to `package-intel`, not to the maintainer directly. Skills invoked via `Skill` carry their own permissions; callers don't inherit the callee's tools.
- **`knowledge-gaps`: replaced `bash find` pipeline with direct `Grep` calls** — The `find … | sed | sort -u` pipeline existed only to feed directory names to grep. ripgrep (which powers the `Grep` tool) respects `.gitignore` and skips `node_modules` automatically, so a single `Grep(glob="**/*.{js,ts,mjs,cjs}", output_mode="count")` call per package replaces the three-step bash pipeline. Also adds guidance for scoped packages (`@scope/pkg`).
- **Removed `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` from `knowledge-gardener`** — the agent operates entirely through Basic Memory MCP tools; no audit step touches the local filesystem.
- **Removed `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` from `package-intel`** — no workflow step reads local project files; all filesystem access goes through `Bash` (for `npm view`, `gh`).
- **Removed `read_wiki_structure` from `package-intel`** — unreferenced in any workflow step; `ask_question` covers the DeepWiki usage.
- **Removed `Glob` from `knowledge-gaps`** — unused; `Grep` handles import counting and the bash `find` (now removed) handled directory discovery.
- **Removed `Agent` from `package-intel`** — the skill never delegates to sub-agents.

### Added

- **`fetch_bookmark_content` to `package-intel`** — genuine functional gap: step 3d could find bookmarks via `find_bookmarks` but had no way to read their content. Now the full bookmark content is reachable.
- **`Skill` to `knowledge-gaps`** — enables step 5 to chain into `/package-intel` for Tier 1 undocumented packages.

## [0.1.0][] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Initial release: `package-intel` skill, `knowledge-gaps` skill, `knowledge-gardener` agent, `knowledge-maintainer` agent, PostToolUse / PreCompact / SessionStart hooks.
