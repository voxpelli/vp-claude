# Knowledge Primer

Surface project-relevant Basic Memory knowledge as a concise context brief.
Identifies which dependencies and tools are documented, loads key gotchas and
patterns, and highlights gaps worth filling.

## Flags

- **`--deep`** — expand observation loading from 800 to 2000 tokens and include
  `[pattern]`, `[feature]`, `[usage]` categories alongside the default critical
  categories. Also expands graph traversal from top 6 to top 12 notes.

## Edge Cases

- **No manifest files found** — report "No package or tool manifest files
  detected in the current directory" and skip steps 2–5. Suggest running
  in a project root.
- **Empty BM directories** — treat as 0 documented. Don't error.
- **Very large dependency lists (100+)** — cap at top 50 by frequency/
  alphabetical for the cross-reference. Note total count in the brief.
- **`--deep` on a small graph (<10 notes)** — treat as compact mode.
  Report "Graph has fewer than 10 notes — showing all relevant notes."

## Workflow

### 1. Identify project stack

Detect manifest files in the current working directory:

| Manifest file | Ecosystem | BM directory | Prefix |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `package.json` | npm | `npm/` | `npm:` |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust | `crates/` | `crate:` |
| `go.mod` | Go | `go/` | `go:` |
| `composer.json` | PHP | `composer/` | `composer:` |
| `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` | Python | `pypi/` | `pypi:` |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby | `gems/` | `gem:` |
| `Brewfile` | Homebrew | `brew/`, `casks/` | `brew:`, `cask:` |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | Actions | `actions/` | `action:` |
| `Dockerfile` | Docker | `docker/` | `docker:` |
| `.vscode/extensions.json` | VSCode | `vscode/` | `vscode:` |

Use `Glob` to check for each manifest. For detected package manifests, use
`Read` to extract dependency names:
- `package.json` → `dependencies` + `devDependencies` keys
- `Cargo.toml` → `[dependencies]` + `[dev-dependencies]` tables
- `go.mod` → `require` block
- `composer.json` → `require` + `require-dev` keys
- `pyproject.toml` → `[project.dependencies]` or `dependencies` key
- `requirements.txt` → package names (before `==`/`>=`/etc.)
- `Gemfile` → `gem '...'` lines

For tool manifests, extract tool names:
- `Brewfile` → `brew "..."`, `cask "..."`, `vscode "..."` lines
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` → `uses:` lines (extract `owner/repo`)
- `Dockerfile` → `FROM` lines (extract image names)
- `.vscode/extensions.json` → `recommendations` array

### 2. Query Basic Memory

For each detected ecosystem, list documented notes:

```
list_directory(dir_name="npm", depth=1)
list_directory(dir_name="crates", depth=1)
list_directory(dir_name="brew", depth=1)
# ... (only for ecosystems detected in step 1)
```

Each `list_directory` call costs ~50 tokens — only query ecosystems that have
manifest files in the project.

Cross-reference: for each dependency from step 1, check if a corresponding
note title exists in the `list_directory` results. Build two lists:
- **Documented** — deps with a BM note
- **Undocumented** — deps without a BM note

### 3. Score relevance

Assign relevance scores to documented notes using three passes:

**Pass 1 — Dependency match (score: 3):**
Notes whose title matches a direct project dependency.

**Pass 2 — Graph expansion (score: 2):**
For top-scoring notes from pass 1, expand via:
```
build_context(url="memory://npm/<pkg>", depth=1, max_related=5)
```
Related notes that appear get score 2 (transitive relevance).

**Pass 3 — Beads/activity boost (score: 1):**
If the project has `.beads/` (check via `Glob(pattern=".beads")`) or
`recent_activity` (fetched in Step 5 below, but peek ahead if needed) shows
notes updated in the last 7 days, those notes get +1 boost.

Sort all scored notes descending. Take top 6 (or top 12 with `--deep`).

### 4. Load observations

For each top-scored note, load critical observations:

```
read_note(identifier="<note-title>", include_frontmatter=true)
```

Extract only observations tagged with critical categories:
- `[gotcha]` — known pitfalls
- `[limitation]` — constraints to be aware of
- `[breaking]` — breaking changes
With `--deep`, also include `[pattern]`, `[feature]`, and `[usage]` categories.

**Token budget:** 800 tokens total (2000 with `--deep`). If observations
exceed the budget, prioritize `[gotcha]` > `[breaking]` > `[limitation]` >
`[pattern]`.

### 5. Check recent activity

```
recent_activity(timeframe="7d", output_format="json")
```

Note which of the top-scored notes were recently updated — these are most
likely to be relevant to current work. Include in the brief output.

### 6. Synthesize brief

Produce a structured context brief:

````markdown
## Project Knowledge Brief

### Stack detected
- npm: 45 deps (38 documented, 7 undocumented)
- brew: 12 tools (10 documented, 2 undocumented)

### Key gotchas
- **npm:fastify** — [gotcha] reply.send() after reply.redirect() causes hang
- **npm:pino** — [limitation] redaction doesn't work on nested arrays

### Recent activity
- 3 notes updated in last 7 days: npm:fastify, npm:pino, brew:ripgrep

### Gaps worth filling
- Top undocumented dep: `npm:undici`
- Run `/knowledge-gaps` for full coverage analysis
- Run `/package-intel undici` to document the top gap
````

### 7. Suggest next steps

Based on the brief:
- If undocumented deps exist in the detected stack: suggest
  `/package-intel <pkg>` for the top one
- If no manifest files found: suggest running in a project directory
- If knowledge graph is empty for all detected ecosystems: suggest
  `/knowledge-gaps` first, then batch `/package-intel`
- If all deps are documented: note good coverage, suggest checking
  for staleness with the knowledge-gardener agent
